BT&RFID Locker is a project based on Arduino microcontroller.

This device lets you open a door secured by mechanical lock (door latch) that
is controlled by servo, using RFID and Bluetooth technology. The latch will 
close automatically if an optical sensor detects that the door is shut.

For controlling the lock by RFID, it is necessary to connect the RFID module. 
The process of unlocking the door will occur after rapproaching an appropriate 
RFID tag. The program lets the user to decide which tags will be authorized.
After launching the device the user specifies the master tag, thanks to which 
it will be possible to add or remove other tags. Master tag cannot be changed 
then, only after reset or re-lounching the program. The microcontroller will 
inform the user about the need of scanning a master tag, the status of the 
scanned tags (whether they are authorized or no) and about posision of the door
(if they are not shut) 

For controlling the lock by BT, there is necessary to connect the Bluetooth
module, which allows the smartphone to contact with the microcontroller by
application. After launching the device and specifing the master tag, it will 
be possible to open the lock by application created in Mitt App Inventor 2.
Before doing that the user has to connect the module with smartphone. If those
devies are already paired, there is possible to connect them in the application,
by choosing -Połącz- button. There should appear a list of available devices.
Then, after choosing the right one, the status of connection at the very top of
the screen should change from "Nie połączono" to "Połączono". To open the lock
it is necessary to enter the right password (otworz) and confirm it by pressing
-OK- button. If the password is correct then atfer clicking the -Otwórz- button
the lock will open.
